<h2>The project requires the following Python libraries:
</h2>
<p>
numpy<br>
pandas<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
scikit-learn<br>
xgboost
</p>
<h2>The project involves the following key steps:</h2>

<h3>Data Loading and Overview:
</h3>
<p>Load the dataset from a CSV file.<br>
Display the first few rows and basic information about the dataset.
</p>
<h3>Visualization:</h3>

<p>Visualize the distribution of the isFraud target variable to understand the class imbalance.</p>
<h3>Data Preparation:</h3>

<p>Convert the type feature to dummy variables.<br>
Define features (X) and target (y) variables.<br>
Split the data into training and test sets.
</p>
<h3>Feature Scaling:
</h3>
<p>Normalize the features using MinMaxScaler to ensure they are on a similar scale.</p>
<h3>Model Training and Evaluation:</h3>
<p>
Train an XGBoost classifier on the training data.<br>
Make predictions on the test data.<br>
Evaluate the model using a classification report, which includes metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This project demonstrates a basic approach to detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning. By preparing the data, visualizing it, and applying an XGBoost classifier, we can effectively identify potential frauds. Further improvements could include trying different models, tuning hyperparameters, and more sophisticated feature engineering.
